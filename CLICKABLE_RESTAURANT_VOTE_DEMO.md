# 🍽️ Clickable Restaurant Vote Demo

## 🎯 **New Feature: Clickable Buttons**

The restaurant voting system now creates **actual clickable buttons** in the group, just like the existing vote system! Users can click buttons to vote instead of typing responses.

---

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Create Restaurant Vote**

**User**: "Create a restaurant vote in group Arz7KwQDd9m"

**Bot Response**:

```
✅ Restaurant booking vote created!

🍽️ Group: Arz7KwQDd9m
📊 Status: Gathering preferences
🗳️ Vote options: 20 options

The group will vote on the missing preferences, then you can use the final booking once all votes are collected.
```

**Group Message with Clickable Buttons**:

Let's decide on our restaurant booking preferences!

Please vote for your preferences:

[Location: London] [Location: Beijing] [Location: New York] [Location: Other]
[Date: Today] [Date: Tomorrow] [Date: This Weekend] [Date: Next Week]
[Time: 18:00 (6 PM)] [Time: 19:00 (7 PM)] [Time: 20:00 (8 PM)] [Time: 21:00 (9 PM)]
[Guests: 2 people] [Guests: 4 people] [Guests: 6 people] [Guests: 8+ people]

### **Step 2: Group Members Click Buttons**

2. **Tracks which option** was selected
3. **Stores the user** who voted

### **Step 3: Check Vote Results**

**User**: "Show restaurant vote results for group Arz7KwQDd9m"

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Button Creation Process**

```python
# Create clickable buttons for voting
button_options = []
for option in vote_options:
    selector = f"vote:{uuid.uuid4().hex}"
    button_options.append({
        "name": option,
        "selector": selector,
        "type": "default",
        "isHidden": "1"
    })
    vote_option_map[selector] = option

# Create payload with text and buttons
payload = {
    "text": vote_message,
    "button": button_options
}

# Send the vote to the group with clickable buttons
send_group_message(group_id, payload)
```

### **Vote Tracking**

- **Unique selectors**: Each button gets a unique UUID
- **Vote mapping**: `vote_option_map[selector] = option`

- **Result counting**: Aggregates votes for each option
