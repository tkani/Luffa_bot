## 🎯 **Key Differences from Previous Version**

### **✅ Real Booking Execution**

**Before**: Only simulated results

```python
# Old approach - just returned mock data
return {
    "status": "simulated",
    "message": "Mock booking created"
}
```

**Now**: Actual restaurant booking execution

```python
# New approach - executes real booking
booking_result = book_restaurant.invoke({
    "location": location,
    "date": date,
    "time": time,
    "guests": guests,
    "cuisine": cuisine
})
```

### **✅ Real Confirmation Details**

**Before**: Generic confirmation

```
✅ Restaurant booking confirmed!
```

**Now**: Detailed confirmation with real data

```
✅ Restaurant booking confirmed based on group votes!

🍽️ Restaurant: Sketch
📍 Location: London
📅 Date: 2024-01-16
🕐 Time: 19:00
👥 Guests: 4
🍴 Cuisine: French
💰 Estimated Total: $160
🆔 Reservation ID: RSV-789123

🍽️ Restaurant: {booking_result['restaurant']}
📍 Location: {booking_result['location']}
📅 Date: {booking_result['date']}
🕐 Time: {booking_result['time']}
👥 Guests: {booking_result['guests']}

send_group_message(group_id, {"text": confirmation_message})
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Tool: `execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes`**

```python
@tool
def execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes(
    group_id: str,
    location: str,
    date: str,
    time: str,
    guests: int,
    cuisine: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute restaurant booking with the winning vote results."""

    # Validate parameters
    if not all([location, date, time, guests, cuisine]):
        raise ValueError("All booking parameters are required")

    # Execute the actual restaurant booking
    booking_result = book_restaurant.invoke({
        "location": location,
        "date": date,
        "time": time,
        "guests": guests,
        "cuisine": cuisine
    })

    # Send confirmation to group
    confirmation_message = f"""✅ **Restaurant Booking Confirmed!**

🍽️ Restaurant: {booking_result['restaurant']}
📍 Location: {booking_result['location']}
📅 Date: {booking_result['date']}
🕐 Time: {booking_result['time']}

    send_group_message(group_id, {"text": confirmation_message})

    return {
        "status": "booking_confirmed",
        "message": f"✅ Restaurant booking confirmed for group {group_id}",
        "group_id": group_id,
        "booking_details": booking_result,
        "vote_based": True
    }
```

### **Agent Integration**

The agent now includes the new tool and handles its execution:

```python
# Import the new tool
from app.tools.book_restaurant_vote import book_restaurant_vote, get_restaurant_vote_results, execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes

# Add to tools list
tools = [..., execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes, ...]

# Handle in response logic
elif tool_name == "execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes":
    tool_result = execute_restaurant_booking_with_votes.invoke(collected_args)

    if tool_result.get("status") == "booking_confirmed":
        booking_details = tool_result.get("booking_details", {})
        result["response"] = f"✅ Restaurant booking confirmed based on group votes!\n\n🍽️ Restaurant: {booking_details['restaurant']}\n📍 Location: {booking_details['location']}\n📅 Date: {booking_details['date']}\n🕐 Time: {booking_details['time']}\n👥 Guests: {booking_details['guests']}\n🍴 Cuisine: {booking_details['cuisine']}\n💰 Estimated Total: ${booking_details['total_estimated_price']}\n🆔 Reservation ID: {booking_details['reservation_id']}\n\n🎉 Booking completed based on group votes!"
